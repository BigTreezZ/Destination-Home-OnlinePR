# Quickstart: 

To keep this README.md file concise & straight-forward I decided to make a official dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/wiki) which has a full write-up on how users can access PlayStation¬ÆHome online with our custom server solution. To download our latest online client builds please check out the release page [here](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/releases). Down below here are the minimum requirements you'll need for this process.

| Requirements For PS3  | Requirements For RPCS3 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) | A PC that supports the [recommened hardware requirements](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart) for running the emulator.   |
| A [PlayStation‚Ñ¢Network Account](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-network/) | [RPCN Account](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Netplay) |
| The latest PlayStation Home Online client from our [release page](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/releases). | The latest custom RPCS3 PlayStation Home Client from our [release page](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/releases). |

# Working services & features:

# üïπÔ∏è PlayStation¬ÆHome Minigame Compatibility List:

![NPIA00005_screenshot_2022_04_30_16_22_56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67494727/166170289-8182e235-31be-4794-9fbb-303e93b5e579.png)

In regards to minigames, unfortunately for certain scenes, not all minigames will work as it requires some extra attention/time for the Destination Home team to get such services up and running in a stable environment. For our beta launch, I've created a straightforward [compatibility list](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/blob/main/PlayStationHome_Minigame_Compatibility_List/PlayStationHome_Minigame_Compatibility_List_Beta.csv) that documents which minigames fully work or not in alphabetical order (A-Z).

# üï∑Ô∏èNotice critical bugs in PlayStation&Home? Here is how you can report them to the Destination Home Team!

- As all with any major software project, even the best applications are known to have bugs, and PlayStation Home online is no exception. With that being said the Destination Home gives serious consideration when it comes to stability for our community. If you see any **critical bugs** please create a ticket/issue [here](https://github.com/DestinationHome/Destination-Home-Online/issues) on the official Destination Home Online repo. In order to fix bugs fast, we ask for users to provide as much documentation as possible. For instance:

  - What client are your using (RPCS3/PS3)?
  - Where did this bug occur? List the scene name.
  - Provide pictures/videos of the error occurring.
  
- If you see an a issue topic that has already **been documented** please refrain from creating another report/thread as this will cause confusion for the development team.
