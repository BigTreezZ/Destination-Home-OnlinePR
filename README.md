This is a work in progress/template for when we have our production servers online.

# Goals:

- Create a write-up on how users can reinstall Home on OFW.
- Make a detailed write up of FAQ/Disclaimers.
- Be sure to review any final package files & RPCS3 builds.
- Create a release page for our public client builds.

# Disclaimers:

Despite the lengthy development on the Destination Home project, there will unfortunately still be some missing services & functions at or after release. These missing features will be documented in this thread. However, as time progress such services *may* come back to Home once the necessary backend implementations have been created for our production servers. 

# Working services & features:

- Official Firmware support on the [latest](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/) PS3 firmware. `As of 2022/29/4, v4.88 is the latest firmware for PS3.`
- We are using the [1.86 version of PlayStation®Home](https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/11/playstation-home-getting-trophies-in-new-update) for our production client.
- Trophy support will be available on PS3. RPCS3 will use its equivalent service for handling trophies.
- Rewards. `This includes furniture, clothing, apartments, etc.`
- Cross-region support `Users can access all regional spaces despite the origin country connected to their PSN account. For instance, a player who is from Japan can access North American scenes and vice-versa.`
- Users who have PlayStation Plus on PSN will have access to additional font colors for their IDs in game & have the ability to customize their avatar's hair in any color. For more information about this feature, feel free to view the video [here]().


# Missing services/functions:

- Clans/Clubs. 
- Commerce Points "Stores" for RPCS3.
- [PlayStation Home Challenge System](https://blog.playstation.com/archive/2013/10/29/playstation-home-update-do-you-accept-the-challenge).
